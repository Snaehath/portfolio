          In addition to
          <span className="highlight"> full stack development</span>, I'm deeply
          passionate about <span className="highlight">Machine Learning </span>
          and <span className="highlight">AI</span>. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in
          both fields independently, mastering the intricacies of web
          development and the transformative power of
          <span className="highlight"> intelligent systems</span>. Now, I'm
          excited to merge these two domains to build innovative solutions that
          push boundaries and spark new possibilities like creating my own
